Description of Application:

After logging in, the User can do a search for books on the 'search' page. Then
the user can add each book they search for to their personal database. After
adding the books they want to read to the dashboard, they can send themselves a
list of all of the books. The list contains the book title, author, and google ID
for each book. This allows the user to look up the book they want to buy on google, amazon,
etc. The user can change their password, delete their account, login, logout, and
view searches without logging in.

This app uses the Google Books API (https://developers.google.com/books).

To create the app the following technologies were used:

Flask web python framework (http://flask.pocoo.org)
PostgresQL through Heroku (https://www.postgresql.org/)
